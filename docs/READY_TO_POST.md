## REDDIT POST 1: r/SaaS (Copy & Paste)

**Title:** I built an AI that fixes database errors automatically - pay only when it works ($0.99-$5/fix)

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SaaS,

I got tired of debugging database errors at 2am, so I built an AI agent that handles them automatically.

**How it works:**
1. Send your error message to my API
2. AI analyzes, generates fix, tests in sandbox
3. Only applies if safe → you pay per successful fix

**Pricing:**
- Database Fix: $5.00
- Customer Support AI: $0.99/ticket
- Sales Agent AI: $2.50/qualified lead
- Email AI: $0.50/response

**Live now:** https://web-production-d678.up.railway.app/

It's pay-per-outcome. No fix = no charge. Crypto payments accepted.

Built this because I needed it for my own projects. Happy to answer questions!

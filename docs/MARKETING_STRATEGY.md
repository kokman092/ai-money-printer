Title: I built an AI that fixes my database errors for $5 (while I sleep)

Body:
Hey r/SaaS,

I was tired of getting woken up at 3am for database errors. 
So I built an AI agent that:
- Receives error webhooks from my app
- Analyzes the error with AI
- Tests the fix in a sandbox
- Applies it only if safe
- Bills me $5 per successful fix

No monthly fees. No on-call rotation. Just works.

Been running it for [X weeks] and it's handled [Y] fixes automatically.

Would love feedback. Happy to share how I built it if there's interest.

🧵 I built an AI that makes money while I sleep.

Not clickbait. Here's what it does:

1/ I have a SaaS with a database. Sometimes it breaks.

2/ Instead of debugging at 3am, I built an AI agent.

It receives error webhooks, analyzes them, tests fixes in sandbox, and applies them automatically.

3/ The kicker? I charge clients $5 per fix.

So while I'm sleeping, the AI is:
- Fixing errors
- Sending invoices
- Collecting crypto payments

4/ Tech stack:
- FastAPI for the API
- OpenRouter (DeepSeek) for AI
- NOWPayments for crypto billing
- Telegram for notifications

5/ Revenue so far: $[X]
Fixes completed: [Y]
Time spent: 0 (after initial build)

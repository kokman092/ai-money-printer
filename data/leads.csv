The context is LLM agents. When an agent uses tools - searching codebases, querying APIs, fetching logs - those tools often return hundreds or thousands of items. You can't stuff everything into the prompt. Context windows have limits, and even when they don't, you're paying per token.

So you need to shrink the data. 500 items become 20. But which 20?
